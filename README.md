# Day 1 – Band Name Generator 🎸

Part of my **100 Days of Python Projects** challenge.  
This project recreates the classic Python Band Name Generator using a **terminal-style web interface**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
The Band Name Generator asks the user for the name of the city they grew up in and their pet’s name, then combines them to generate a fun band name.

---

## 📚 What I Learned
- Understanding **basic program flow** (input → process → output)
- Translating **beginner Python logic into JavaScript**
- Working with **string concatenation**
- Handling **user input dynamically** in a terminal-style UI

---

## 🛠 How It Works
1. User enters the name of the city they grew up in  
2. User enters their pet’s name  
3. The app combines both inputs and displays a generated band name  

## Example format:
    Welcome to the Band Name Generator. 
    What's the name of the city you grew up in? Boston 
    What's your pet's name? Buddy Your band name could be: Boston Buddy
