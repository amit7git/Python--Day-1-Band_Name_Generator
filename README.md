# Day 1 - Band Name Generator

## Project Overview
The Band Name Generator takes the user's input for their city and pet name to generate a unique band name. It's a simple Python project aimed at practicing basic programming concepts.

## What I Learned
- **Printing and Input:** Learned how to print to the console and take user input.  
- **String Manipulation:** Practiced concatenating strings to create a band name.  
- **Variables:** Used variables to store user input and manipulate them.

## How It Works
1. The program prompts the user for their city name and their pet's name.  
2. It concatenates these inputs to create a band name in the format:
 CityName PetName  
## Code Highlights
- Using `input()` to capture user input.  
- Simple string concatenation to create the band name.  

## Example
    Welcome to the Band Name Generator.
    What's the name of the city you grew up in? Boston
    What's your pet's name? Buddy
    Your band name could be: Boston Buddy
